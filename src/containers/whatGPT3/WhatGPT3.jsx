      <Feature title="Vilka Är Echo" text="Echo Esports is a professional gaming organisation founded in 2020 by the most successful World of Warcraft players of all time.

Challenging ourselves to compete at the highest levels is at the centre of what Echo does. We don’t cut corners. We respect each other and reject toxicity within our team and in our community.

Continuing the standard of excellence set by our founding raid team, we integrate our approach into our business practices, driving our focus for Echo as an organisation.

We are more than just an Esports team. We pride ourselves on our ability to use our platform to help generate meaningful change. Working with charities such as Rise Above the Disorder and INHOPE has allowed us to champion causes close to our hearts.

Our success is shared. With both our community and our partners, we are fortunate enough to share a vision towards pushing industry boundaries and improving experiences. Echo is whole only through the family of our community and our partners. For this reason, it is so important for us to be honest, genuine and transparent, reflecting these values in every decision we make.

Strength comes from within and without: we are committed to engaging and entertaining our community with our competitive drive, mutual respect, and a lot of memes.

      <Feature title="Gingi, THE LEGENDARY STIEFBRUDER" text="Gingi is our legendary Stiefbruder. As a triple MDI champion and member of the team since Legion, Gingi is a highly skilled big pumper. He is our resident range DPS genius, playing at the absolute highest level.
His enthusiasm shines and is communicative in the raid. Fair warning, you might occasionally hear an outburst of Danish swear words." />
      <Feature title="Fragnance, THE OMEGA FAST LEARNER" text="Fragnance, another triple MDI champion, is a long time member of the team and might just be one of the most talented multi-classing players in the world. 

His heart resides with the DH, but throw at him any DPS spec in the game, and this man will play it at the highest possible level in 0.2 seconds. If you ask us, he’s outside of the Matrix and can get to “know Kung-Fu” at any time." />
      <Feature title="Naowh, THE SWEDISH TITAN" text="Back-to-back-to-back MDI Champion and multi-spec tank, Naowh re-joined the team coming into the Shadowlands as our super Swedish stud tank and Stiefbruder.

Full time memer, Naowh is always cracking a joke during the raid, keeping the motivation high. When he's not streaming, you'll find him on a beach or a fancy restaurant somewhere in Malta, living the life." />
